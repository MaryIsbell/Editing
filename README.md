# Transforming Humanities Texts
This project brings open pedagogy into conversation with scholarly editing to support humanities courses in disciplines including philosophy, literature, history, and anthropology. It is designed to encourage rigorous (also, authentic and enjoyable) reading experiences for students. Our goal is to build documentary editions that grow and change to incorporate the work of the students who read and investigate them. A robust set of faculty resources—assignment templates, technical guidance, and workshops—will encourage adopters and adapters of editions to join in the fun. Learning the principles of scholarly editing (including markup languages like HTML and XML and the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative) is liberating, and can fundamentally change the way one teaches with texts. If you already believe this, please get in touch about joining the team. If you’re intrigued but had to Google “Text Encoding Initiative,” please stay tuned. This project is for you.
